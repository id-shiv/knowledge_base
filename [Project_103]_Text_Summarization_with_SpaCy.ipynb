I also have another server on Windows Server 2016 that also fails, but it has port 445 open. I can't find a way to try and install the components again. I uninstalled and reinstalled the extension but it didn't show me the acceptance page again. I'm not sure where to get support for this, the dell pages have nothing about support.\n",
